/**
 * Build the Reactor: in-process automation that closes the re-dispatch loop on
 * the implementor edge (ADR 0005). On each {@link Reactor.reconcile} it
 * enumerates every PRD under `root`, reads each PRD's dispatch view, computes the
 * cross-PRD implementor frontier (reusing `computeFrontier` via the sweep), and
 * runs the existing `runDispatch` per PRD — the very spawn edge the `d` keybind
 * uses, sharing the same `git`/`spawn`/`logFailure` seams. So completing one
 * Issue's `done` unblocks its siblings, and the next reconcile dispatches them:
 * one `d` cascades through the dependency graph with no second keypress.
 *
 * It sits *beside* `createDispatcher`/`createReviewer`, not on top of them: it
 * reuses only the spawn-edge core (`runDispatch`), deliberately not their
 * preview/`lastRead` caching, which is a human-flow concern and a re-entrancy
 * footgun in a sweep.
 *
 * Two invariants keep it safe:
 *
 * - **Re-entrancy guard.** A reconcile that fires while one is already running
 *   is a no-op. This is for clean logs / no redundant work, not correctness —
 *   flip-before-spawn (ADR 0002) is the real lock: `runDispatch` flips an Issue
 *   off `ready-for-agent` before spawning, so overlapping passes can't
 *   double-spawn even without the guard.
 * - **Totality.** Every path is total — a vanished/unreadable PRD during the
 *   sweep is skipped, and no Reactor code may throw out of the watcher callback
 *   and crash the board. This matches the dispatcher/reviewer contract.
 *
 * **Spawn-failure suppression.** A spawn that fails to launch is rolled back to
 * `ready-for-agent` and logged by the spawn edge (unchanged) *and* recorded in a
 * session-scoped {@link FailedSet} keyed by `(issueId, edge)`. The reconcile
 * subtracts that set from each swept frontier, so a rolled-back Issue — still
 * `ready-for-agent` on disk — is not re-picked-up and retried forever. The set
 * is built per instance, so a fresh board (reopen) retries: a permanent failure
 * re-attempts at most once per session, logged each time, never routed to
 * `human-review`.
 *
 * This slice covers the implementor edge only; once the reviewer auto-spawn
 * lands, the edge-keyed failed-set covers it with no further change.

 * logs any post-flip failure — none of which throws — so the loop is total.
 *
 * Two failed-set integrations sit around that unchanged edge:
 *
 * - **Subtract.** Drop any `spawn` entry whose `(path, implementor)` is already
 *   recorded, so an Issue rolled back by an earlier failed launch — still
 *   `ready-for-agent` on disk — is not re-spawned this pass.
 * - **Record.** Wrap `logFailure` so the same record the edge appends to the
 *   durable log also lands in the failed-set. The wrap records first, then
 *   delegates; both are best-effort and the delegate already never throws.
 *
 * Both sides key the set by the Issue's *full path* (`prdDir/filename`), not its
 * bare filename: the Reactor sweeps across every PRD, and Issue filenames are
 * only unique within a PRD, so a bare-filename key would let a failure in one
 * PRD suppress a same-named Issue in another. The failure record carries only
 * the filename, so the wrap re-joins it with this loop's `prdDir` — which is
 * exactly `issue.path` (reader builds `path` as `prdDir/filename`), so the two
 * sides agree.
