# Ideas & future considerations

A running backlog of feature ideas and considerations for Overseer that aren't yet
committed work. Not the issue tracker — this is the holding pen before an idea is
shaped into a PRD or issues. See `CONTEXT.md` for domain language.

## Theme: Overseer launches agents but doesn't own them

A framing that several ideas below are facets of, worth stating once on its own.

Overseer is a **read-only viewer of files**; agents are **fire-and-forget `claude --bg`
processes** that write the files back (ADR 0002). The board only ever sees the agents'
*footprints in the files* — never the processes themselves. That boundary buys real
simplicity and a free **resume** (close and reopen the board; it re-reconciles whatever
the files now say — there is no session state to restore). But it has one sharp edge,
and it's the edge a user *feels* once the reactor is running: **Overseer can launch an
agent but cannot watch, pause, or kill it.** The moment it spawns, the agent has left
Overseer's world.

So, separating what's solved from what's only wished-for:

- **Manual vs. automatic** — *solved.* One rule: a human ignites a PRD with `d`; the
  reactor is cruise control from there. The **auto-run** toggle (`a`) turns cruise
  control off — global, in-memory, on by default (see `CONTEXT.md` → Auto-run).
- **Resume** — *solved for free*, by level-triggering off the files (above).
- **Live tracking of running agents** — *open gap.* The board shows `in-progress` /
  `in-review` cards, so you can see *that* agents are working — but not *which* `claude
  --bg` is which, whether one is hung, or its output. ("Surface reactor state" below
  gestures at this; it is not yet a design.)
- **True pause of in-flight agents** — *open gap.* Toggling the reactor off (or pausing
  a PRD) stops it spawning *new* agents; the ones already running keep running. There is
  no kill switch. "Pause" today means "stop starting more," not "stop."

The next real design frontier, when the unease bites, is therefore **not more
automation** — it is giving Overseer a way to *observe and rein in* the agents it
launches, without abandoning the read-only/level-triggered model that makes resume free.
That likely means a process-tracking seam that lives *beside* the file viewer, not inside
it. Until then, live tracking and true pause are wishes, not committed solutions.

## Ideas

### Pause / resume development of a PRD

A way to pause and later resume development of a PRD. While paused, the dispatcher
should not spawn (or keep spawning) agents for that PRD's issues; resuming picks
development back up. Open questions: where does the pause state live (PRD frontmatter
vs. external state, given Overseer is a read-only viewer of the files), how it surfaces
on the board, and how in-flight agents are handled at the moment of pausing.

### Surface reactor state on the board

The reactor is **visually invisible** in v1 — its only diagnostic surface is the
durable failure log. Two states that look identical to a healthy board but aren't:
(1) a spawn-failed Issue that rolled back to its eligible status and is now
**suppressed** by the session failed-set (looks like a normal `ready-*` card, but the
reactor is deliberately ignoring it); (2) idle vs. actively-working vs. at-rest. A
future UI pass would surface these — e.g. a card marker for spawn-failed/suppressed
Issues (mirroring the `human_review_reason` marker), and/or a board status line. For
now everything goes to the log; we surface in the UI later.

### Configurable AI-review turns and effort

The AI review loop ships with a hardcoded cap of **3** `/code-review` passes at
**medium** effort (see `CONTEXT.md` → Review outcome). Once there are real runs to
calibrate against, promote both to `config.toml` knobs — a per-board (or eventually
per-PRD) iteration cap and effort level — rather than baking the v1 defaults in
forever.

### Viewport scrolling (overflow on the alternate screen)

"Always full screen" (UI Polish part 1) renders the board on the terminal's
**alternate screen buffer** (à la vim/htop), sized to fill the viewport. The alt
buffer has **no scrollback** (standard terminal behaviour — Ink's own docs warn of
it), so when a column has more cards than fit, the overflow is **clipped and
unreachable** — there is no scroll and no scrollback to recover it. This converts an
overflow that used to be merely awkward (scroll the terminal) into genuinely hidden
content on small terminals.

We **knowingly accepted clipping** for part 1 rather than block full-screen on it.
The follow-up is in-app **viewport scrolling / virtualization** within a column (and
possibly horizontal paging across columns) so no card is ever unreachable. Until then,
a small terminal can hide cards with no recourse.

### UI polish follow-ups

Small UI fixes noted against the full-screen board and `?` help modal (UI Polish
part 1):

- **Help modal should be a true modal, not a screen takeover.** It currently
  replaces the board; it should overlay it (board visible/dimmed behind) so opening
  help doesn't lose the user's place.
- **Bottom bar needs spacing between the `auto` indicator and the `?` keybind.**
  They currently render flush against each other; add separation so they read as
  distinct elements.

### Central keybind registry

Keybinds are hardcoded inline as `if (input === "…")` branches in `App.tsx`'s
`useInput`. The `?` help modal (UI Polish part 1) lists them as a **second hardcoded
copy**, guarded against drift only by a test. A future refactor would lift keybinds
into a single `{key, label, level}` registry that *both* the input handler and the
help modal consume, eliminating the drift risk — deferred from part 1 to avoid
dragging an input-architecture refactor into a polish pass.
