# Ideas & future considerations

A running backlog of feature ideas and considerations for Overseer that aren't yet
committed work. Not the issue tracker — this is the holding pen before an idea is
shaped into a PRD or issues. See `CONTEXT.md` for domain language.

## Theme: Overseer launches agents but doesn't own them

A framing that several ideas below are facets of, worth stating once on its own.

Overseer is a **read-only viewer of files**; agents are **fire-and-forget `claude --bg`
processes** that write the files back (ADR 0002). The board only ever sees the agents'
*footprints in the files* — never the processes themselves. That boundary buys real
simplicity and a free **resume** (close and reopen the board; it re-reconciles whatever
the files now say — there is no session state to restore). But it has one sharp edge,
and it's the edge a user *feels* once the reactor is running: **Overseer can launch an
agent but cannot watch, pause, or kill it.** The moment it spawns, the agent has left
Overseer's world.

So, separating what's solved from what's only wished-for:

- **Manual vs. automatic** — *solved.* One rule: a human ignites a PRD with `d`; the
  reactor is cruise control from there. The **auto-run** toggle (`a`) turns cruise
  control off — global, in-memory, on by default (see `CONTEXT.md` → Auto-run).
- **Resume** — *solved for free*, by level-triggering off the files (above).
- **Live tracking of running agents** — *open gap.* The board shows `in-progress` /
  `in-review` cards, so you can see *that* agents are working — but not *which* `claude
  --bg` is which, whether one is hung, or its output. ("Surface reactor state" below
  gestures at this; it is not yet a design.)
- **True pause of in-flight agents** — *open gap.* Toggling the reactor off (or pausing
  a PRD) stops it spawning *new* agents; the ones already running keep running. There is
  no kill switch. "Pause" today means "stop starting more," not "stop."

The next real design frontier, when the unease bites, is therefore **not more
automation** — it is giving Overseer a way to *observe and rein in* the agents it
launches, without abandoning the read-only/level-triggered model that makes resume free.
That likely means a process-tracking seam that lives *beside* the file viewer, not inside
it. Until then, live tracking and true pause are wishes, not committed solutions.

## Ideas

### Pause / resume development of a PRD

A way to pause and later resume development of a PRD. While paused, the dispatcher
should not spawn (or keep spawning) agents for that PRD's issues; resuming picks
development back up. Open questions: where does the pause state live (PRD frontmatter
vs. external state, given Overseer is a read-only viewer of the files), how it surfaces
on the board, and how in-flight agents are handled at the moment of pausing.

### Surface reactor state on the board

The reactor is **visually invisible** in v1 — its only diagnostic surface is the
durable failure log. Two states that look identical to a healthy board but aren't:
(1) a spawn-failed Issue that rolled back to its eligible status and is now
**suppressed** by the session failed-set (looks like a normal `ready-*` card, but the
reactor is deliberately ignoring it); (2) idle vs. actively-working vs. at-rest. A
future UI pass would surface these — e.g. a card marker for spawn-failed/suppressed
Issues (mirroring the `human_review_reason` marker), and/or a board status line. For
now everything goes to the log; we surface in the UI later.

### Configurable AI-review turns and effort

The AI review loop ships with a hardcoded cap of **3** `/code-review` passes at
**medium** effort (see `CONTEXT.md` → Review outcome). Once there are real runs to
calibrate against, promote both to `config.toml` knobs — a per-board (or eventually
per-PRD) iteration cap and effort level — rather than baking the v1 defaults in
forever.
